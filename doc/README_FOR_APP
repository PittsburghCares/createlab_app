Information:
------------

  This is a Rails 2.3 application.
  It makes use of the geokit gem and google maps for location lookups and map usage.
  ImageMagick is also required for thumbnail generation.
  The mysql2 gem acts as the database adapter.
  All required plugins and gems (except mysql2) come bundled, so there is no need to install anything (except perhaps ImageMagick).



Installation:
-------------

  1. ImageMagick is required to create the project/page thumbnails. To check that ImageMagick is installed on your sever, run the following command:

    convert --version

  If information about ImageMagick is printed out, you are good to go. If it says 'command not found' you'll have to install ImageMagick.
  Installation depends upon your OS, so follow the instructions from the ImageMagick website: http://www.imagemagick.org/


  2. The mysql2 gem is required for interaction with the MySQL database. It could not be bundled with this project because its files differ depending
  upon what OS you are running. To install this gem, run the following command:

    gem install mysql2 -v 0.2.18

  Version 0.2.18 (not the latest release) is required because this is a Rails 2.3 app



Configuration:
--------------

  The following configuration files need to be modified before deployment:


  config/environment.rb

    General mailer settings and general global application information (like the organization name)

  config/mailer.yml

    Mailer settings (username, password, provider, etc)

  config/database.yml

    Database configuration

  config/initializers/site_keys.rb

    Modify the secret key (just change a few of the values (A-F, 0-9 ONLY))

  config/initializers/session_store.rb

    Modify the REST_AUTH_SITE_KEY but only BEFORE you create any new users (just change a few of the values (A-F, 0-9 ONLY))



Rake Tasks:
-----------

Once you've setup the database configuration and actually created the database, run the following command
from the root directory of ../createlab_app on your sever:

  rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"
  
The next task creates default roles for your user accounts. The default roles are "admin" and "user". To create these roles,
run the following command from the root directory of ../createlab_app on your sever:

  rake db:seed RAILS_ENV="production"



Restarting the Rails App:
-------------------------

  Anytime you make changes to any of the files of this app, you'll need to restart Rails before your changes actually take affect.
  To do this, run the following command from the root directory of ../creatlab_app on your sever:

  touch tmp/restart.txt



Static Content:
---------------

  Static pages for the site (ie general content pages for your organization that are not meant to change much) are
  found in: app/views/static/

  The homepage can be modified from the following file: app/views/home/index.html.erb



Layout:
-------

  The general layout of the backend and frontend can be modified in the following files:

  app/views/layouts/backend.html.erb
