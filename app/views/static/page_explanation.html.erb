A Page represents a funded effort or an aspect of a project. Pages are the pictures and a short descriptions visitors 
to the website see. Each page is linked to a (small vertical) thumbnail at the bottom of the screen.
<br/><br/>
Generally, a project (e.g. ChargeCar) will have several pages to represent various aspects of its outreach 
(e.g. a Mechanics Training page and Community Events page). A page's data (number of people and 
organizations engaged) can include data from multiple events that fall under the effort it represents 
(participants in all training sessions for Charge Car mechanics will be counted under the same page).

If what you need is not already listed, you can create a new Page by clicking the icon to the right of the dropdown. 
Note that you will be directed away from this form and anything you have already entered will be lost. Once you are 
done creating the new Page entry, you'll automatically be directed back here.
